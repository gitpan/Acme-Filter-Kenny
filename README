NAME
    Acme::Filter::Kenny - Kenny source filter

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::Filter::Kenny;

    Or

      use Acme::Filter::Kenny qw/:iq_kenny/;

DESCRIPTION
    This source filter translates code in Kenny-speak back to normal perl
    before actually parsing the rest of the stream. When used with the
    :iq_kenny tag, Acme::Filter::Kenny will translate only those lines that
    look like Kenny-speak, not all of them.

    Be aware that :iq_kenny applies heuristics, it might get some things
    wrong, so use with care!

EXAMPLE
      use Acme::Filter::Kenny;
      pfmpffmffpppfmp "Mfpmpppmfpmfppf fppppfpffpmfmpm!\ppp";

    This will print "Hello World!", and so will this:

      use Acme::Filter::Kenny qw/:iq_kenny/;
      print <<EOF
      Mfpmpppmfpmfppf fppppfpffpmfmpm!
      EOF
